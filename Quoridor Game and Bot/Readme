		Sending moves to the server:
			The format for sending a move is: moveType row column
			moveType: 0 for moving the pawn
			1 for horizontal wall
			2 for vertical wall
			NOTE: when you send the row and column for wall, you are specifying the center of the wall. So values for row and
			column will be in the range [2,9]A pawn can move only one step at a time and cannot move diagonally. If the opponent’s pawn is on the way, your
			pawn can jump over the opponent’s pawn. In such a case, you need to specify the values for the final position. If you
			specify the position where the opponent’s pawn is present, it will be considered as an invalid move.
			e.g. If A is at (2,5) and B is at (3,5) and I need to make a move that jumps over B, then I need to send (4,5) to the
			server and not (3,5). Sending (3, 5) will be considered invalid.
